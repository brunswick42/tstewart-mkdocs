Summary
-------

I am a technical writer leveraging my background in physics and computer science to write for technical audiences. I have 10 years experience writing Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) technical narratives to clearly explain software development activities. As a researcher, I worked with scientists, engineers, and software developers on large-scale collaborative projects. My experience as a teaching assistant in physics and computer science courses made me realize how much I enjoy sharing my knowledge to help people solve problems.

Key Skills
----------

* Skilled technical writer with experience writing detailed SR&ED technical narratives and academic papers for conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journals.
* Ability to research and quickly learn new subjects and technologies.
* Good collaboration skills. Proven track record of successfully working with people in various technicial fields.
* Strong communication and presentation skills. Presented talks at multiple conferences, workshops, and collaboration meetings.
* Able to explain complex technical concepts to technical and non-technical audiences.
* Comfortable programming in C/C++ and Python. Some experience with Java, C#, and JavaScript.
* Basic knowledge of Git and Github.

Experience
---------
**LibreOffice Documentation Team Member** (2020-Present)

**Freelance Technical Writer** (2010-Present)

* Write detailed technical narratives to support SR&ED tax credit applications.
* Research new and unfamiliar technologies to understand and write about their limitations.
* Ensure technical narratives demonstrate how projects meet the requirements of the SR&ED tax credit program.
* Played a key role in the success of hundreds of SR&ED tax credit applications.

**Communications Intern, University of Ottawa Heart Institute** (2009-2012)

* Edited new web content for the complete overhaul of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute website.
* Managed and updated content using OpenText RedDot CMS.

* Facilitated communication between students, teaching assistants, and professors.

**Teaching Assistant, Simon Fraser University** (2006-2008) 

* Assisted professors teaching Physics 101 (Physics for Life Sciences), Physics 190 (Introduction to Astronomy), and Physics 346 (Energy and the Environment).
* Duties included instructing students, maintaining office hours, and evaluating students.
* Successfully introduced physics concepts to students from other faculties. 
* Helped students correctly diagnose and resolve issues, and improve problem-solving skills.

**Research Assistant, Simon Fraser University** (2006-2007)

* Collaborated on ATLAS, a large international particle physics experiment based in Geneva, Switzerland.
* Analyzed data and performed programming duties in C/C++/Python using the ROOT data analysis framework.
* Spearheaded a wiki project using DokuWiki software to create and share software setup guides and configuration files with other researchers in the High Energy Physics group.

**Managing Editor, Canadian Undergraduate Physics Journal** (2006-2007)

* Worked closely in a team to successfully publish four issues of the journal.
* Duties included bookkeeping and accounts payable and receivable.
* Responsible for securing and maintaining strong relationships with sponsors.

**Research Assistant, University of New Brunswick**  (Summer 2004)

* Worked with a professor to successfully implement an analysis of sphere packings. 
* Published a paper detailing the findings of our research at the Powders & Grains International Conference on the Micromechanics of Granular Media at the Institute of Computer Physics of the University of Stuttgart.

Education
---------

**Pursued Master of Computer Science, Carleton University** (Incomplete, 2009-2012)
