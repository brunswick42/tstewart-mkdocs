# Hi, I'm Travis

I'm a technical writer and sometimes software developer located in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, with 10 years experience writing SR&ED technical reports. Prior to that, I worked on high energy particle physics experiments at Fermilab and CERN, and wrote algorithms to control tandem mass spectrometers. Right now I'm trying to use my technical skills to transition into software and API documentation because I miss learning about new technologies and being directly involved in technical projects.

I'm currently involved in the LibreOffice and Godot Engine open source projects, and looking new places to make a difference.
